      workflows that respond to user behavior as it happens, providing timely and relevant responses.

- **Complex Customer Journey Orchestration**:
    - Automate the management of customer journeys with sophisticated workflows that guide users through personalized
      experiences. This can include multi-step campaigns, targeted offers, and customized user pathways based on
