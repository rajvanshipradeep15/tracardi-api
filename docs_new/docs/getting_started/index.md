## Getting Started

To start collecting data in Tracardi, you need to set up the system, integrate it with your website or application, and
configure event sources and event tracking. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

### 1. Install Tracardi

You need to have [Tracardi installed](../installation) and running. This can be done using Docker, Helm, or directly
from the source code. Ensure that all necessary components, such as the backend, frontend, and optional modules, are
installed.

### 2. Configure Event Sources

Event sources are the points where data enters Tracardi. You need to define these sources in the Tracardi system to
start collecting data from them.

* **Creating an Event Source**: Go to the Tracardi GUI, navigate to Inbound Traffic, and add a new event source. You'll
  need to provide details such as the name, type, and URL of the event source.

### 3. Integrate Tracardi JavaScript Snippet

To collect data from your website, you need to integrate the Tracardi JavaScript snippet into your web pages. Add the
JavaScript Snippet. You can find the snippet by clicking the event source and selecting `Use & Javascript` Tab:

```html title="Example configuration snippet, that should be placed on all pages"

<script>
    !function(e){"object"==typeof exports&&"undefined"!=typeof module..
</script>
<script>
    const options = {
        tracker: {
            url: {
                script: 'http://your-tracardi-url/tracker',
                api: 'http://your-tracardi-url'
            },
            source: {
                id: "<your-event-source-id>"
            }
        }
    }
</script>
```

!!! Tip

    Do not forget to replace your-tracardi-url with the URL of your Tracardi API server and your-event-source-id with the ID of your event source.

### 4. Send Events via JavaScript

Define and send events from your web pages using JavaScript. Events can represent various user actions such as page
views, clicks, form submissions, etc. Events properties are the data that is associated with the event, e.g. page url,
form data, etc.

```javascript title="Example snippet for data collection"
    window.tracker.track("page-view", {
      "url": window.location.href, 
      "title": document.title, 
      "category": "product details"
    });
    window.tracker.track("button-click", {
      "button-id": "subscribe-button"
    });
```

### 5. Verify Integration

After adding the JavaScript code and sending events, verify that the data is being collected properly in Tracardi.

* **Check Event Data**: Navigate to the Tracardi GUI and check the Events section to see if the events from your web
  pages are being captured. Data should appear withing 3 to 5 seconds.

### 6. Configure Workflows

Workflows define how events are processed in Tracardi. You can set up workflows to act on the collected
data. Workflows are not necessary to collect user data. They can automate the customer journey and allow messaging user or personalizing their customer journey. 

* **Create Workflows**: Go to the Processing section, create a new workflow, and define the nodes and actions based on your requirements.
