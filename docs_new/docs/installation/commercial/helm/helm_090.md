# Tracardi Installation with HelmChart version 0.9.0

This document provides comprehensive instructions for installing the commercial Tracardi application on a Kubernetes (
K8s) cluster using the Helm chart.

## Prerequisites

Before initiating the installation process, ensure you have completed the following prerequisites:

1. **Install K8S and Helm**: Make sure that you have installed K8S and Helm.

2. **Obtain Helm Chart and License Information**: Upon agreeing to the license agreement, you will receive a Helm chart
   archive. Extract the contents of this archive into a folder named "tracardi". You will also receive a Docker Hub
   login token, which is required to access the commercial Docker images. Additionally, make sure you have the Tracardi
   license key.
3. Install dependencies ([ElasticSearch](../../dependencies/helm/elasticsearch.md), [Redis](../../dependencies/helm/redis.md), [Apache Pulsar](../../dependencies/helm/pulsar.md), [Mysql](../../dependencies/helm/mysql.md))

## Introduction

When installing Tracardi using HelmCharts, you can customize the deployment by providing your own `values.yaml` file.
This file overrides the default values defined in the HelmChart, allowing you to tailor the installation to meet your
specific needs.

### Advice on Setting Up Dependencies

We strongly recommend setting up the dependent services (Redis, Elasticsearch, MySQL, and Pulsar) in separate
namespaces. This strategy has several advantages:

1. **Upgrade Management**: Each new version of Tracardi can be deployed in a new namespace, facilitating migration and
   testing without disrupting the current setup.
2. **Isolation**: Keeping dependencies isolated helps in managing and troubleshooting issues more effectively.
3. **Avoiding In-Place Upgrades**: Placing everything in one namespace would necessitate an in-place upgrade for
   Tracardi, which is not recommended due to the increased risk of disruptions and complications.

## Overall process description

The installation takes the following steps:

* Dependencies installation
* Init script for dependencies setup (it is part of the tracardi pod)
* API/GUI and workers installation

# Installation settings

## Local installation settings

To customize your installation create local `values.yaml` file and define custom setting for your setup.

Your custom `values.yaml` file will contain only the values you wish to change from the defaults. Any values not
specified in your custom file will use the defaults provided by the HelmChart. This approach keeps your configuration
concise and easy to manage.

## Configuration of Services Used by Tracardi

Dependencies configuration is the part in helm configuration that defines all the services that Tracardi needs to connect to. 

### Elasticsearch Configuration

The Elasticsearch configuration specifies the necessary settings to connect Tracardi to an Elasticsearch service. This
includes the host, port, schema, and authentication details. Here's a detailed breakdown:

```yaml
elastic:
  name: es1  # The name identifier for the Elasticsearch service
  host: elastic-std-svc.elastic-standalone.svc.cluster.local  # The hostname for the Elasticsearch service
  schema: http  # The schema to use for connecting to Elasticsearch (http/https)
  authenticate: false  # Whether to use authentication when connecting to Elasticsearch
  port: 9200  # The port on which Elasticsearch is running
  verifyCerts: "no"  # Whether to verify SSL certificates (yes/no)
  index:
    shards: 3  # Number of primary shards for the index
    replicas: 1  # Number of replica shards for the index
```

## Telemetry Configuration

### Introduction

The telemetry configuration in Tracardi allows for monitoring and logging various metrics and logs related to the
system's performance and operations. This feature is currently experimental and is disabled by default. You can safely
remove this section from your custom `values.yaml` file.

### Configuration Fields

The `telemetry` section in the `values.yaml` file includes several fields to configure the telemetry settings. Here’s a
detailed breakdown of each field:

```yaml
telemetry:
  disabled: true  # Whether telemetry is disabled
  name: "tracardi"  # The name for telemetry
  log_level: "info"  # The logging level for telemetry
  export:
    endpoint: ""  # Endpoint for exporting telemetry data
    headers: ""  # Headers to use when exporting telemetry data
    metrics: ""  # Metrics configuration for telemetry
    logs: ""  # Logs configuration for telemetry
    attributes: ""  # Attributes for telemetry
    time_out: 30000  # Timeout for telemetry export in milliseconds
    delay: 5000  # Delay for telemetry export in milliseconds
    batch_size: 512  # Batch size for telemetry export
```

### Explanation of Fields

| Field             | Description                                      |

| **time_out**      | Timeout duration for exporting telemetry data.   |
| **delay**         | Delay between telemetry export operations.       |
| **batch_size**    | The number of telemetry entries to include in each export batch. |

## Load Balancer Configuration

### Introduction

The load balancer configuration section in the `values.yaml` file is used to set up a load balancer for your Tracardi
installation, particularly when deploying on DigitalOcean. This section includes options to enable or disable the load
balancer and to specify a certificate ID for secure connections.

### Configuration Fields

The `digitalOcean` section includes the following fields:

```yaml
digitalOcean:
  loadBalancer: false  # Whether to use a DigitalOcean load balancer. Set this to true if you need a load balancer
  certId: ""  # Certificate ID for DigitalOcean
```

### Explanation of Fields

| Field             | Description                                                                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **loadBalancer**  | Determines whether a load balancer will start.                                      |
| **certId**        | The certificate ID for securing connections through the DigitalOcean load balancer. |

Set digitalOcean.loadBalancer to true if you need a load balancer

Add this to your local `values.yaml`

```yaml
digitalOcean:
  loadBalancer: true
```

## General Tracardi Configuration

The general configuration settings for Tracardi govern how the system operates, including multi-tenancy, ID prefixes,
demo mode, system events, and visit handling. Below is a detailed breakdown of each configuration
option.

### Configuration Fields

```yaml
config:
  multiTenant:
    multi: "no"  # Whether multi-tenancy is enabled

      enabled: true  # Whether failover storage is enabled
      size: 1Gi  # Size of the failover storage
  primaryId: "emm-" 
  demo: "no"  # Whether demo mode is enabled. Disable on production
  systemEvents: "no"  # Whether system events are enabled.
  enableVisitEnded: "no"  # Whether to enable visit ended events. Will the system register when the visit ends.

## Docker Image Settings

### Overview

The image settings section in the `values.yaml` file is used to configure the API component of Tracardi. This includes
settings for both the private and public APIs, such as Docker image details, replica configurations, logging levels, and
service ports. Proper configuration of these settings ensures the APIs operate efficiently and meet the deployment
requirements.

Private API is Used for communication with GUI while Public for collecting Data.

## Bridges Configuration

### Overview

The bridges configuration section in the `values.yaml` file specifies the settings for the services responsible for
collecting data from different channels. This includes the queue bridge configuration, detailing Docker image settings,
enabling or disabling the bridge, setting the number of replicas, and logging levels. By default none standard bridges are disabled. You can safely remove this configuration form you local `values.yaml` file.

### Configuration Fields

```yaml
# Bridges configuration for services responsible for collecting data from different channels
bridge:
  queue:
    image:
      repository: tracardi/com-bridge-queue  # Docker repository for the queue bridge image
      tag: 0.9.0.3  # Image tag for the queue bridge
      pullPolicy: IfNotPresent  # Image pull policy
    docker:
      enabled: false  # Whether Docker is enabled for the queue bridge
      replicas: 1  # Number of replicas for the queue bridge
      config:
        loggingLevel: "INFO"  # Logging level for the queue bridge
```
