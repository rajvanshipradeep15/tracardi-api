# Why are some of the update timestamps on profile fields different?**

Each field in a profile may be updated at different times during the customer's journey. Some fields are
filled earlier, while others may be updated later. Additionally, the timestamp of a field can change during the process
of profile merging, depending on the system's merging rules and the specific interactions or events that trigger updates
to the profile.
