# Describe some of the merging scenarios.

When merging data fields in a system, the behavior and outcome depend significantly on the rules defined for the merging
process. Here's a breakdown of some of the scenarios:

1. **Merging two empty fields**:
    - If two empty fields are merged, typically, the merged field remains empty. This is because merging two
      non-values (empty fields) generally results in no change.

2. **Merging one empty field with a non-empty field**:
    - Usually, the system will skip the empty field and retain the value of the non-empty field in the merged result.
      This prevents overwriting meaningful data with an empty value.

3. **Merging two fields with different timestamps**:
    - When fields with different timestamps are merged, the system will select the field to retain based on the defined
      merging strategy. Common strategies might include keeping the most recent data (based on timestamp) or the oldest,
      depending on the requirements. Thus, the timestamp of the merged field will be that of the selected field,
      preserving the context of when the retained data was last updated.

4. **Merging and summing fields with different timestamps**:
    - If the fields are summed (e.g., numerical data being aggregated), the timestamp of the resulting field is
      typically set to the time of the summation. This indicates when the new value was computed, providing a current
      timestamp reflecting the latest update.
