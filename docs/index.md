## How Tracardi Performs Its Services

Tracardi collects data throughout customer journeys[^1], capturing this information in the form of events[^2] that
include both context and event-specific data. Each event is linked to a profile that is maintained over the entire
interaction period with the customer, whether through a website, mobile application, or other platforms.

Customer data is aggregated into a profile[^3], and the process of attaching this data to profiles is defined using the
graphical editor within the Tracardi system. This editor allows administrators to specify how data is linked to
profiles, ensuring a comprehensive view of each customer's interactions.

By integrating Tracardi with your system, such as a SaaS service, you can track each customer's interactions with your
company. The information collected may encompass various consumer decisions, including:

- Whether the customer decides to subscribe to your services
- The circumstances under which they make these decisions (event context)
- Whether the customer is satisfied with your service or considers canceling it

This detailed tracking and aggregation of customer data enable businesses to better understand and respond to customer behavior and preferences.

A customer journey is an entire experience a customer has while communicating with a brand. It considers the complete
interaction roadmap from brand discovery to purchasing and beyond. The focus isn't on transactions, but rather how the
customer feels after interactions with the brand.

In programming and software design, an event is an action or occurrence recognized by software, often originating
asynchronously from the external environment, that may be handled by the software. Computer events can be generated or
triggered by the system, by the user, or in other ways.

A user profile is a collection of settings and information associated with a user. It can be defined as the explicit
digital representation of the identity of the user with respect to the operating environment, which could be operating
systems, software applications or websites. The user profile helps in associating characteristics with a user and helps
in ascertaining the interactive behavior of the user along with preferences.
