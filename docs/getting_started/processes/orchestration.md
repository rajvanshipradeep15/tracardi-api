# Orchestration

Orchestration in Tracardi refers to the automated coordination and management of complex destinations and workflows.
Both destinations and workflows are mechanisms to send data out of the system, but they operate with different levels of
complexity and control.

- **[Workflows](../components/workflow.md)**:
  Workflows offer granular control over the entire process. They allow the definition of complex rules and conditions
  for when and how data should be sent to external systems. This flexibility enables intricate data processing,
  transformation, and routing based on specific criteria.

- **[Destinations](../components/destination.md)**:
  Destinations provide a straightforward method for sending events and profiles as they arrive in the system. While less
  complex than workflows, destinations are easier to configure and use, making them ideal for simple data forwarding
  tasks.
