# Audiences and Activations

## Audiences

The term "audience" refers to a select group of users specifically targeted for certain campaigns or business
operations. The formation of an audience is dynamic and tailored to the goals of specific projects. It involves applying
a set of logical criteria that segments these users from the broader customer pool. These criteria become relevant
during an activation event to pinpoint who presently makes up the audience.

## Activations

Activation involves engaging with a predetermined audience by integrating them with an external system, such as a
marketing automation platform. This process relies on the specific criteria defined for the audience to gather the
relevant members and relay their data to the chosen system. As audiences are dynamic—calculated in real-time—their
makeup can fluctuate depending on the set conditions at the time of activation. For instance, an audience defined by
recent activity, like "customers who made a purchase in the last 30 days," will continuously update as new transactions
occur and older ones become outdated.
