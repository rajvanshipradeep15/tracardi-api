# Event response

Event response in Tracardi refers to the data that is sent back from the server after processing an event. This response
typically includes information about the current profile ID and may also contain additional data based on the
configurations and logic defined within workflows. 

## Structure of Event Response

Event responses in Tracardi are structured in JSON format and contain various keys and values. The response typically
includes information related to different aspects of the workflow, such as saved events, errors, IDs, and types. For
example, in the provided example response:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "data": ["a", "b"]
  },
  "ux": {},
  "profile": {
    "id": "0d2d9dc5-0d60-471e-956f-8766dcb8aba2"
  }
}
```

The above response includes information about segments, profile ID, etc. 

Tracardi provides you with the flexibility to configure response data within each event type workflow. This means that
you can define what data should be included in the response generated by a specific workflow, which is bound to a
defined event type and its properties. The response data can be structured and organized using response keys, such as
`segments`, which are defined fields that contain the data returned by a workflow and can be copied from a profile, for
example.

By configuring response data in your event type workflows, you can specify the data that should be included in the
response generated by that particular workflow. This allows you to return and data captured and processed in Tracardi
based on your specific requirements and business needs. You can define the response keys that should be included in the
response, which can be used in downstream processes for further analysis, actions, and decision-making 
(e.g. content personalisation).
