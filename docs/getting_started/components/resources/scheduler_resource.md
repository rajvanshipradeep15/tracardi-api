Schedule handles scheduled events. You can schedule and postpone any event. For example, it will allow you to deliver
the messages to customers after they end the visit on your site.

# Resource configuration and set-up

The scheduler schedules an event to be sent to Tracardi after a specified period of time. To do this, you must define
the Tracardi API URL where you want to send the event. You can send the event back to the same instance you are working
on.

Type the Tracardi API url in the __Schedule settings__. 

# Dependencies

Scheduler uses redis to schedule the events.
