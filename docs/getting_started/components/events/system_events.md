# System Events

System events in Tracardi are automatically generated events that record the internal workings of the system as they relate to the customer journey. These events provide insights into critical milestones and actions within the user experience, such as when a visit starts, when it ends, or when a profile is created. They can be enabled or disabled based on configuration settings. Here’s a detailed overview of system events in Tracardi:

### Characteristics of System Events

1. **Automatically Generated**: Created by Tracardi to document significant actions and states within the customer journey.
2. **Customer Journey Focused**: These events are tied to the customer journey and provide context about user interactions and system responses.
3. **Configurable**: System events can be turned on or off during system configuration based on specific needs.

### Use Cases for System Events

- **Tracking Customer Journey**: Monitoring key actions within the customer journey, such as visits, profile creations, and session terminations.

### Examples of System Events
