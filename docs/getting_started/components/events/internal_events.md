# Pre-build event types

Tracardi 0.8.1 provides a set of internal events that can be used to track customer journey on your website or application.
These events come with default properties that can be used to collect data without the need for manual copying.

Using internal events simplifies the use of Tracardi and allows for better analytics. When an internal event is used,
the system automatically detects it and fills up the profile and session with appropriate data.

However, if the default event does not expect the data that you want to send, don't worry. You can still send the data
and copy it manually. Other defined properties will be copied automatically, and the missing ones will be saved in the
event and can be moved to the profile manually.

The following are some examples of Tracardi internal events:

* __Page View__: This event is triggered when a customer visits a new page on your website or application. It captures the
  URL of the page and the time of the visit.

* __Search__: This event is triggered when a customer performs a search on your website or application. It captures the
  search query and the category of the search.

* __Signup__: This event is triggered when a customer signs up for an account on your website or application. It captures
  the customer's first name, last name, email address, and login information.

* __Identification__: This event is triggered when a customer logs into their account on your website or application. It
  captures the customer's login information.

* __Purchase Order__: This event is triggered when a customer makes a purchase on your website or application. It captures
  the details of the purchase, including the product ID, name, price, and quantity.

* __Cart Update__: This event is triggered when a customer adds or removes items from their shopping cart on your website or
  application. It captures the details of the update, including the product ID, name, price, and quantity.

Using Tracardi internal events helps you understand your customers' behavior and preferences, allowing you to optimize
your website or application for better engagement and conversions.
