# Action or Action Plugin in Tracardi

An action or action plugin is a modular unit of functionality that performs specific operations within a
workflow. Actions are the building blocks of workflows, and they define the tasks to be executed when certain conditions
or triggers are met.

## Key Features of Action Plugins

1. **Modularity**:
    - Action plugins are self-contained modules that can be reused across different workflows. This modularity allows
      for easy customization and extension of Tracardi's capabilities.

2. **Flexibility**:
    - They can perform a wide range of tasks, from data transformation and enrichment to external system integrations
      and conditional logic.

3. **Configuration**:
    - Action plugins can be configured with various parameters and options to tailor their behavior to specific
      requirements. Configuration can include input fields, resource connections, and processing rules.

4. **Integration**:
    - They enable integration with external APIs, databases, messaging systems, and other services, allowing Tracardi to
      interact with a wide array of external systems.

## Common Types of Action Plugins

1. **Data Transformation**:
    - Plugins that manipulate or transform data, such as converting data formats, aggregating data, or filtering data
      based on specific criteria.

2. **External Integrations**:
    - Plugins that connect to external services and APIs, such as sending emails, making HTTP requests, or writing data
      to a database.

3. **Conditional Logic**:
    - Plugins that evaluate conditions and route data accordingly, such as IF/ELSE branches, switch cases, or
      comparisons.

4. **Data Enrichment**:
    - Plugins that enhance data by adding additional information, such as looking up data from external sources or
      calculating new fields based on existing data.
