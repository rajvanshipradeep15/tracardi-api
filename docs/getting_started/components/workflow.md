# Workflow

A workflow is a sequence of automated processes designed to manage and manipulate data as it flows through
the system. Workflows define how events are processed, how data is transformed, and what actions are taken based on
specific conditions or triggers.

## Key Components of a Workflow:

1. **Nodes**:
    - Individual units of work within a workflow, each representing a specific action or operation. Nodes can perform
      various tasks, such as data transformation, conditional checks, or external API calls.

2. **Edges**:
    - Connections between nodes that define the flow of data from one node to another. Edges determine the path that
      data follows through the workflow based on the outcome of each node's operation.

3. **Triggers**:
    - Conditions that initiate the execution of a workflow. Triggers can be based on specific event types,
      such as a user action, data change.

4. **Actions**:
    - Operations performed by nodes within the workflow. Actions can include data enrichment, filtering, transformation,
      routing, and external system integration.

5. **Conditions**:
    - Logical expressions used to make decisions within the workflow. Conditions evaluate data and determine the path
      data should take through the workflow.

## Workflow Management

- **Design**:
    - Workflows are designed using the Tracardi Workflow Editor, a visual interface that allows users to create and
      connect nodes, set conditions, and define actions.

- **Execution**:
    - Once defined, workflows are executed automatically when their triggers are activated. Tracardi ensures that data
      flows through the workflow as specified, performing each action and following each edge and condition.

- **Monitoring**:
    - Tracardi provides tools to monitor and debug workflows, ensuring that they perform as expected and identifying any
      issues that need to be addressed.
