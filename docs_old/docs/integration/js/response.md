# Event response

Event response in Tracardi refers to the data that is sent back from the server after processing an event. This response
typically includes information about the current profile ID and may also contain additional data based on the
configurations and logic defined within workflows. 

## Structure of Event Response

Event responses in Tracardi are structured in JSON format and contain various keys and values. The response typically
includes information related to different aspects of the workflow, such as saved events, errors, IDs, and types. For
example, in the provided example response:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "segments": ["a", "b"]
  },
  "ux": {},
  "profile": {
    "id": "0d2d9dc5-0d60-471e-956f-8766dcb8aba2"
  }
}
```

The above response includes information about segments, profile ID, etc. 

Tracardi provides you with the flexibility to configure response data within each event type workflow. This means that
you can define what data should be included in the response generated by a specific workflow, which is bound to a
defined event type and its properties. The response data can be structured and organized using response keys, such as
`segments`, which are defined fields that contain the data returned by a workflow and can be copied from a profile, for
example.

By configuring response data in your event type workflows, you can specify the data that should be included in the
response generated by that particular workflow. This allows you to return and data captured and processed in Tracardi
based on your specific requirements and business needs. You can define the response keys that should be included in the
response, which can be used in downstream processes for further analysis, actions, and decision-making 
(e.g. content personalisation).

## Capturing Tracker Response

Tracardi allows you to capture the event response, which can be useful for customizing page content based on customer
segments or utilizing data returned from workflows. In the provided example, the event response is captured using the
window.onTracardiReady event and accessed through the context.response object. For example:

```javascript title="Example" 
 // Change page if has response custom.text
 window.onTracardiReady.bind( ({tracker, helpers, context, config}) => {
     if(context?.response?.custom?.text) {
         const customText = document.getElementById('custom')
         customText.innerText = context?.response?.custom?.text
     }
 })
```

In the above example, the context.response.custom.text value is accessed from the response and used to update the
content of an HTML element with the id attribute of 'custom'. This allows you to dynamically change the page content
based on the data returned from Tracardi workflows.

## Binding Page Elements

You can also bind events to page elements. To do that you will need to be sure that the page loads and every element of
the page is accessible.

To do that bind the function to `window.onTracardiReady` property.

```javascript title="Example" linenums="1"
window.onTracardiReady.bind( ({helpers, context, config, tracker}) => {
      // Code that binds events.
    }
});
```

The whole configuration should look like this.

```html title="Example" linenums="1"

<script>
        !function(e){"object"==typeof exports&&"undefined"!=typeof module?module.exports=e():"function"==typeof define&&define.amd?define([],e):("undefined"!=typeo...

        window.onTracardiReady.bind( ({helpers, context, config, tracker}) => {
              // Code that binds events.
            }
        });

        const options = {
            tracker: {
                url: {
                    script: 'http://192.168.1.103:8686/tracker',
                    api: 'http://192.168.1.103:8686'
                },
                source: {
                    id: "ee2db027-46cf-4034-a759-79f1c930f80d"
                }
            }
        }
        
  </script>
```

The above example will run on every page after the events are triggered. It will not run if TRACARDI did not respond.

The function have the following parameters.

* *helpers* - this is a reference to class that will allow you to raise another events
* *context* has the response from Tracardi to you initial events. It will have profile data, and if configured debug
  information.
* *config* - it is the tracker config as defined in options
* *tracker* - it is tracker object.

## OnTracardiReady triggered on selected page

You can bind functions to `windows.OnTracardiReady` on selected pages together with track events. Then it will be
executed only on selected pages.

```javascript
window.tracker.track("page-view",{}); // (1)
window.onTracardiReady = ({tracker, helpers, context, config}) => {
    // Code
}
```

1. Set tracks first. Then bind a function.

### Binding events to page elements

Then you can write a code that binds for example onClick event on a button to tracardi event.

This is the example code that you can bind to `window.onTracardiReady`

```javascript title="Example" linenums="1"
({helpers, context}) => {
    const btn0 = document.querySelector('#button')

    helpers.onClick(btn0, async ()=> {
        const response = await helpers.track("page-view", {"page": "hello"});

        if(response) {
            const responseToCustomEvent = document.getElementById('response-to-custom-event');
            responseToCustomEvent.innerText = JSON.stringify(response.data, null, " ");
            responseToCustomEvent.style.display = "block"
        }
    });
}
```

It looks for the element with id="button"

```javascript title="Example" linenums="1"
const btn0 = document.querySelector('#button')
```

Then using helpers binds onClick on that element to function:

```javascript title="Example" linenums="1"
async ()=> {
        // Send event to tracardi
        const response = await helpers.track("page-view", {"page": "hello"});

        if(response) {
            const responseToCustomEvent = document.getElementById('response-to-custom-event');
            responseToCustomEvent.innerText = JSON.stringify(response.data, null, " ");
            responseToCustomEvent.style.display = "block"
        }
    }
``` 

Inside the function we send the event to Tracardi:

```javascript title="Example" linenums="1"
const response = await helpers.track("page-view", {"page": "hello"});
```

And on response we make a string from JSON response and bind it as innerText of element with
id='response-to-custom-event'

## Wrap up

The whole configuration looks like this:

```html title="Whole code" linenums="1"
<script>

    // Compiled code must be always in the first line
    
    !function(e){"object"==typeof exports&&"undefined"!=typeof module?module.exports=e():"function"==typeof define&&define.amd?define([],e):("undefined"!=typeo...

    // Configure tracker

    const options = {
        tracker: {
            url: {
                script: 'http://192.168.1.103:8686/tracker',
                api: 'http://192.168.1.103:8686'
            },
            source: {
                id: "ee2db027-46cf-4034-a759-79f1c930f80d"
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Bind some function when TRACARDI responds

    window.onTracardiReady.bind(({helpers, context}) => {
        const btn0 = document.querySelector('#button')
    
        helpers.onClick(btn0, async ()=> {
            const response = await helpers.track("page-view", {"page": "hello"});
    
            if(response) {
                const responseToCustomEvent = document.getElementById('response-to-custom-event');
                responseToCustomEvent.innerText = JSON.stringify(response.data, null, " ");
                responseToCustomEvent.style.display = "block"
            }
        });
    });

</script>
```

## Tracardi helpers

You probably noticed that we use helpers to bind events. We used onClick method to bind to click event. You might need
to bind to other than click event. To do that use addEventListener:

```javascript title="Example" linenums="1"
const btn0 = document.querySelector('#button')                 
helpers.addListener(btn0, 'mouseover', async ()=> {
    // Code
});
```

Helpers also have track method that let you send custom event to Tracardi at any time.

This is how you can use it:

```javascript title="Example" linenums="1"
const response = await helpers.track("new-page-view", {"page": "hello"});
```
