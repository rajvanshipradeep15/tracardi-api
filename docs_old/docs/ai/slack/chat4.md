# I have a use case where I want to wait for 10 seconds after a user performs an action, like viewing a product, and then display a promotion popup related to that product in my mobile app. How can I implement this in Tracardi?

If you're using the open-source version of Tracardi, time-based operations are not available. However, in the commercial
version, there is a pause and resume action.
