# Can Tracardi import data from CSV files and external sources using a secure API?

Tracardi supports data imports from external sources using its API. While there isn't a dedicated CSV import feature, a
script can be used to import CSV data through regular Tracardi API endpoints. Importing data directly from the machine
where the CSV is saved can often be more advantageous for large datasets, rather than uploading it to the server first.
