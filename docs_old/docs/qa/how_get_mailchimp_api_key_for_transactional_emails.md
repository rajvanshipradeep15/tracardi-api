# How to get API Key for one-to-one transactional e-mails

To obtain the API key for sending transactional emails with Mailchimp (specifically through the Mandrill service),
follow these steps:

* Log in to your Mailchimp account.
* Click on your account icon in the top-right corner.
* Select "Profile".
* In the "Profile" section, choose "Extras" and then "API keys".
* Under the "Your API keys" section, click on "Add a Mandrill API Key" (not "Create A Key").
* You will be redirected to the Mandrill website.
* Follow the instructions on the Mandrill site to set up your sending domain and verify ownership.
* Once you have completed the domain verification, you will find the API key on the Mandrill site.
* Copy the API key and use it for sending transactional emails, such as with the Tracardi Form.

Please note that verifying your domain and making changes to your DNS records may be required in order to send
one-to-one emails successfully. Failure to complete the domain verification process may result in rejected emails with
the error message "unsigned" when sending from Tracardi.
