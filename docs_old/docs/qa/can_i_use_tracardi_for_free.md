# Can I use Tracardi for free?

Yes, you can use Tracardi for free as an individual or a small company. Tracardi offers a free open-source version that
provides comprehensive features and the ability to leverage AI-driven insights and automation.

However, it's important to note that if you plan to create a software-as-a-service (SAAS) platform that sells Tracardi
or if you intend to resell Tracardi to your customers, you would need to consider the commercial open-source version,
which is designed for marketing agencies and larger corporations. The commercial open-source version may have additional
features and support tailored to meet the needs of businesses operating at a larger scale.

In summary, Tracardi offers a free open-source version for individuals and small companies, but if you plan to sell or
resell Tracardi as a service, you would need to consider the commercial open-source version.
