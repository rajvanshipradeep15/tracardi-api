# How to quickly copy node configuration from node to node (action to action)?

Creating a New Node by Copying an Existing Node

To create a new node that replicates the configuration of an existing node, follow these steps:

* Identify the node you wish to copy.
* Access the advanced configuration options for the new node. Look for the JSON icon, typically located in the toolbar.
* Click on the JSON icon to open the advanced configuration panel. This panel allows you to view and edit the JSON
  representation of the node's configuration.
* This JSON contains all the necessary information to recreate the node.
* Select the entire JSON code and copy it to the clipboard. You can usually do this by right-clicking and choosing the "
  Copy" option, or by using the keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+C or Command+C).
* Create a new node in your desired location. Ensure that the new node you create is the same type as this existing
  node.
* Once the new node is created, access its advanced configuration options as before and open the JSON panel.
* In the JSON panel, paste the previously copied JSON code into the text field. To do this, right-click inside the field
  and choose the "Paste" option, or use the keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+V or Command+V).
* After pasting the JSON code, click Save.
* Review the configuration of the new node to ensure that everything has been copied correctly. Make any necessary
  adjustments or modifications if needed.
* Save the changes and exit the advanced configuration mode.
