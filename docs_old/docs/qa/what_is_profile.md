# What is profile?

In the context of Tracardi, a profile refers to a detailed record or representation of a person. It contains information
about characteristics, interests, and activities. The profile is updated based on incoming events and data from external
systems, and it includes both public and private data.

Tracardi collects data from customer journeys. These interactions are captured as events. Each event is assigned to a
profile that is maintained throughout the customer interaction. Tracardi aggregates customer journey data in the profile
using a graphical editor, where the administrator defines the method of attaching data to the profile.
