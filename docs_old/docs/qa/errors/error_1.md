# What does the error message "Address already in use" in Tracardi mean?

The error message "Address already in use" in Tracardi indicates that the port (in this case, port 8686) that Tracardi
is attempting to use is already being used by another process or service. Reconfigure Tracardi to use other then 8686
port, for example 8687.
