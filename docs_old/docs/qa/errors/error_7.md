# What is the reason for the "Failed connection with error: CORS request did not succeed" error in Tracardi API connection?

The "Failed connection with error: CORS request did not succeed" error indicates that the HTTP request, which utilizes
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), has failed at the network or protocol level. This error is not directly related to
CORS but rather signifies a fundamental network issue. Possible causes include browser plugins blocking the request or
attempting to access an HTTP resource from an HTTPS origin.
