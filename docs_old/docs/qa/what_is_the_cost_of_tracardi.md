# What is the cost of Tracardi?

Tracardi's cost varies depending on your usage and requirements. It offers a free open-source version for individuals
and small companies, providing comprehensive features and AI-driven insights. If you plan to sell Tracardi as a SaaS
platform or for larger-scale operations, there is a commercial open-source version with additional features and tailored
support.

To get specific pricing information based on your needs, it's best to contact Tracardi directly. However, it's worth
noting that Tracardi is generally more cost-effective compared to other commercial platforms, with costs reported to be
5 to 50 times lower. Keep in mind that hosting costs are not included, as Tracardi is an on-premises solution.
