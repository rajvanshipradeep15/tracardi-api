# What is Auxiliary data?

Auxiliary data refers to additional or supplemental data that is associated with an event. It provides extra information
or context related to the event but may not be directly essential for its core purpose. Auxiliary data can include
various details, such as additional metadata, supporting information, temporary storage for obsolete or migrating data,
or any other relevant data that does not fit into the predefined event schema. It allows for the flexibility of storing
miscellaneous or non-standardized data related to the event without altering the predefined structure or losing any
important information.
