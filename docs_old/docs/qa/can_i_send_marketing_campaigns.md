# Can I send marketing campaigns from Tracardi? Is Tracardi a Marketing Automation Platform?

Tracardi supports marketing-related features and integrations, but it is not a dedicated marketing automation system. It
is designed to enhance customer engagement and improve the overall consumer experience.

That means that you can trigger campaigns but Tracardi is not designed for Marketing Automation tasks.

!!! Note

    That Tracardi can send one-to-one emails and SMSes.
