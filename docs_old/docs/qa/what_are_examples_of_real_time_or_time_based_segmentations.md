# Give me examples of real time segmentation?


1. Real-time Email Engagement Segmentation:
   __Trigger__: "Email Open" event. 
   __Condition__: Check if the customer has opened a specific email or a series of
   emails.
   __Action__: Add the profile to the "Engaged Email Subscribers" segment.

2. Time-triggered Inactive Customer Segmentation:
   __Trigger__: Periodic time-based trigger (e.g., every week). 
   __Condition__: Check if the customer has not made a purchase or visited the website within a specified timeframe. 
   __Action__: Add the profile to the "Inactive Customers"
   segment.

3. Real-time Purchase Behavior Segmentation:
   __Trigger__: "Purchase" event. 
   __Condition__: Check if the customer has made a certain number of purchases within a
      given period. 
   __Action__: Add the profile to the "Frequent Buyers" segment.

4. Real-time Weather-based Segmentation:
   __Trigger__: "Purchase" event. 
   __Condition__: Check if the customer has purchased ice cream.
   __Action__: Connect to a weather provider to retrieve the weather information for the customer's location at the time
   of purchase. If it is raining, add the profile to the "Ice Cream Lovers" segment.

5. Real-time Abandoned Cart Segmentation:
   __Trigger__: "Add to Cart" event. 
   __Condition__: Check if the customer has not completed the purchase within a
   specified timeframe. 
   __Action__: Add the profile to the "Abandoned Cart" segment.

6. Real-time Event Pattern Segmentation:
   __Trigger__: "Session Closed" event. 
   __Condition__: Detect if the customer has added products to their basket but did
   not make a purchase during the session. 
   __Action__: Add the profile to the "Browsing Shoppers" segment.

Remember, these workflows are just examples, and you can customize them based on your specific segmentation goals and
requirements. Tracardi provides the flexibility to design workflows that suit your business needs and perform
