# What are the main differences between Apache Unomi and Tracardi?

Tracardi and Apache Unomi are both customer data platforms (CDPs) but have some key differences in terms of features and
focus. Here are the main differences between Tracardi and Unomi:

1. **Data Collection and Integration**: Tracardi provides a wide range of data collection options, including API
   integrations, webhook support, and data import/export capabilities. It offers flexible data integration capabilities
   to gather data from various sources. Unomi, on the other hand, focuses on real-time data collection and offers
   integration via API calls.

2. **AI-Driven Insights and Automation**: Tracardi emphasizes AI-driven insights and automation. It leverages machine
   learning algorithms through integration with external systems like ChatGPT, etc., providing advanced automation
   capabilities for personalizing customer experiences and optimizing marketing campaigns. Unomi, on the other hand,
   supports basic personalization and segmentation but does not have built-in AI capabilities.

3. **Workflow and Journey Orchestration**: Tracardi provides a visual workflow editor and journey orchestration
   capabilities, allowing users to design complex customer journeys and automate marketing workflows. Unomi, on the
   other hand, focuses more on customer profile management and segmentation, with less emphasis on workflow
   orchestration.

4. **User Interface and Ease of Use**: Tracardi aims to provide a user-friendly interface and a low-code/no-code
   environment, making it accessible to marketers and non-technical users. Unomi, being an Apache project, does not have
   a graphical user interface (GUI) and requires more technical expertise for configuration and customization.

5. **Commercial Support**: Tracardi offers commercial support and enterprise-grade features through its commercial
   open-source version. Unomi, being an Apache project, primarily relies on community support, although some companies
   may offer commercial support for Unomi as well.

6. **Licensing**: Tracardi is licensed under the MIT License with the additional Common Clause. This licensing allows users
   to freely use, modify, and distribute Tracardi while also imposing some restrictions on the commercial use of the
   software. On the other hand, Apache Unomi is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. This license allows users to
   freely use, modify, and distribute Unomi without imposing any additional restrictions on its use, including
   commercial use.

7. **Maturity**: Tracardi is a younger product compared to Unomi but offers a more extensive set of features. Tracardi
   provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). It also offers built-in automation capabilities, integration
   bridges to connect with various systems, and destinations for data export. In contrast, Apache Unomi requires more
   programming and customization work to add similar features. It provides a solid foundation for customer data
   management and segmentation but may require additional development effort to achieve the same level of automation,
   integration, and user interface capabilities as Tracardi.
