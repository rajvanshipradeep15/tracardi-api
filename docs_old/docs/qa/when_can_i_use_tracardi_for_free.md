# When can I use Tracari for free?

Tracardi offers a free open-source version that allows individuals and small companies to use the system at no cost.

However, if your intention is to create a software-as-a-service (SAAS) platform that involves selling or reselling
Tracardi to customers, you would need to consider the commercial open-source version. This version is specifically
designed for marketing agencies and larger corporations, offering additional features and tailored support to meet the
needs of businesses operating at a larger scale.

In summary, Tracardi can be used for free by individuals and small companies. For commercial purposes involving selling
or reselling Tracardi, the commercial open-source version is recommended.
