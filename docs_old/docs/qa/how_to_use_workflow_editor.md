# How to use workflow editor?

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use the Workflow Editor in Tracardi:

__Open the Workflow Editor__: When you start processing data in Tracardi, open the Workflow Editor. You will see a screen
with all the nodes that you can put on the canvas.

__Search for nodes__: On the left side of the screen, you can search for nodes by typing their names, such as "start node."
Then, you can drag and drop the node onto the canvas.

__Connect nodes__: To connect nodes, select the node you want to connect and drag an edge to the next node. You can
double-click on a node to rename it and configure how it works.

__Configure nodes__: Nodes have forms that you can fill out to configure how they work. For example, the start node may only
accept a certain event type, such as a page view. You can also see a short description of each node by hovering over it.

__Save the workflow__: After configuring the nodes, save the workflow. You can have multiple start nodes on one canvas to
process different event types.

__Deploy the workflow__: Remember that the workflow is a draft until you click "deploy." Once deployed, the workflow will be
visible and functional on production.

__Check node documentation__: Some nodes have additional documentation that you can access by clicking on them. The
documentation may contain information on configuring the node with advanced JSON setup.

__Use ports__: Nodes have input and output ports that you can click on to see additional documentation. You can use these
ports to pass data between nodes.

__Use advanced runtime settings__: You can access advanced runtime settings by double-clicking on a node. This includes
options to skip a node, stop the flow on a node, and stop the workflow if a value does not change.
